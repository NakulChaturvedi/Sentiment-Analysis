TOOLS USED IN THE TWITTER ANALYSIS


1.	TweetTokenizer tool: This tool splits characters into individual tokens while also removing punctuation, @ characters, and other extraneous characters. TweetTokenizer is also capable of handling and tokenizing emojis and emoticons. Since these characters are often used in modern text when conveying emotion and sentiment, they are imperative in understanding tweet content. Consequently, we retained emojis and emoticons in the tweets, and they were tokenized as if they were words themselves. 
2.	Machine Language Tools:
